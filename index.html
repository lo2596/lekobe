        <p>"Focus on the solution and outcome, not the obstacle or problem"-Dean Graziosi</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a durshlet named "LeKobe Jordan". He was not just some ordinary durshlet. He was the last descendant of the Great "Durshlet Von Cambodian" Durshlet Von Cambodian could do things you never imagined! He had the power to manipulate the minds of every single durshlet there ever was at once.
With that power, he created an empire.</p>
<p>One day LeKobe was out exploring in the woods with his casual #24 lakers jersey with his yellow and red sweatband to go along with his flight air jordans.</p>
